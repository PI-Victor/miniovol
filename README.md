#### miniovol

A Docker plugin (experimental 1.12) for storing data on [Minio](https://minio.io).

###### Prerequisites
Since the new plugins system is marked as experimental this plugin works only with the [Docker 1.12 experimental binary](https://github.com/docker/docker/releases).  
Should work with Docker 1.13 off the shelf, when the plugin system is marked as stable.  
See Docker docs about the [managed plugin system](https://docs.docker.com/engine/extend/#/installing-and-using-a-plugin).
