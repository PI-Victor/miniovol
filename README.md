#### miniovol

This works with [Docker 1.13](https://github.com/docker/docker/releases) off the shelf.
See Docker docs about the [managed plugin system](https://docs.docker.com/engine/extend/#/installing-and-using-a-plugin).  

This plugin provisions new Minio buckets and mounts them inside Docker volumes.
